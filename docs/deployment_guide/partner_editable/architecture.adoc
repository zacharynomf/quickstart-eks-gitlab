|^[AWS-WA]^|AWS Well-Architected compliant, which includes favoring platform&#8209;as&#8209;a&#8209;service (PaaS) for scaling, high&#8209;availability and self&#8209;healing for non&#8209;PaaS resources.
|^[GL-RAR]^|Compliant with GitLab reference-architecture requirement or recommendation. This applies only to items where the reference architectures are opinionated.
|===

This deployment sets up an operational {partner-product-short-name} instance.

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two or three Availability Zones. ^[AWS-WA]^
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.^1^ ^[AWS-WA]^
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.^1^
** In one public subnet, a Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in the private subnets. The bastion host is also configured with the Kubernetes Kubectl command line interface (CLI) and the `helm` CLI for managing the Kubernetes cluster as well as the AWS CLI for general AWS management. ^[AWS-WA]^
* In the private subnets:
** An Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 Kubernetes nodes.^2^ ^[AWS-WA]^
** An Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster to create the Kubernetes control plane.
** An Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) cluster for {partner-product-short-name} and Praefect databases. ^[GL-RAR][AWS-WA]^
** An Amazon ElastiCache Redis cluster for caching. ^[GL-RAR][AWS-WA]^
** A Praefect node Auto Scaling group. https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures/10k_users.html#cloud-native-hybrid-reference-architecture-with-helm-charts-alternative[{partner-product-short-name}'s Cloud Native Hybrid reference architecture with Helm Charts (alternative)^] for Praefect to implement an Amazon EC2 compute instance. ^[GL-RAR][AWS-WA]^
** An Auto Scaling group with Gitaly nodes. The {partner-product-short-name} hybrid architecture with Helm Charts calls for Gitaly to be implemented on an Amazon EC2 compute instance and to use non-Network File System (NFS) storage for the file system containing Git repositories. ^[GL-RAR][AWS-WA]^
* AWS Secrets Manager for securely storing credentials.
* Multiple Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets for PaaS of non-Git file systems and Git Large File Storage (LFS) systems. ^[GL-RAR][AWS-WA]^. For more information, refer to <<Object storage for {partner-product-short-name} storage types>>. ^[GL-RAR][AWS-WA]^
* An Amazon Route 53â€“hosted zone for Domain Name System (DNS) name resolution. ^[AWS-WA]^
* An AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for TLS traffic encryption. ^[AWS-WA]^
* An Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) domain for outgoing email messages. ^[AWS-WA]^
* Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights integration and agent for compute instance. ^[AWS-WA]^
* AWS Systems Manager parameter store for storing infrastructure as code (IaC) parameters and outputs. ^[AWS-WA]^
* Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) for external access and internal load balancing requests. ^[AWS-WA]^

=== Bundling

This Partner Solution provides the following features for bundled provisioning of container registry, backup, log aggregation, and monitoring:

* Amazon Linux 2 throughout and benefits from Amazon-specific optimizations for performance and compute density for both EKS and EC2 hosts. ^[AWS-WA]^
* All {partner-product-short-name} logs are aggregated into CloudWatch Logs with CloudWatch Instance Agent and CloudWatch Container Insights. ^[AWS-WA]^
* EKS workload monitoring with CloudWatch Container Insights. ^[AWS-WA]^
* Preconfigured {partner-product-short-name} backup.
* Prometheus is always deployed.
* Sets up container registry at `registry.<subdomain>`. ^[AWS-WA]^

=== Security

If you deploy {partner-product-short-name} with a private Kubernetes endpoint, an optional bastion host is available (preloaded with AWS, EKS and Kubernetes management utilities, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions for cluster management). For remote access, configure the bastion host with or without SSH keys, and securely access it using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. The bastion host has command audit logging enabled, and the log is uploaded to CloudWatch Logs.

==== Application secrets

This Partner Solution stores generated secrets in AWS Secrets Manager (for example, it generates an initial root password). ^[AWS-WA]^

==== Data encryption

* Data in transit:
** SSL for front end HTTP. ^[AWS-WA]^
** SSL for {partner-product-short-name} to Amazon S3. ^[AWS-WA]^
** SSL for {partner-product-short-name} to Amazon RDS PostgreSQL. ^[AWS-WA]^
** SSL for {partner-product-short-name} to Amazon ElastiCache Redis. ^[AWS-WA]^
** SSL for {partner-product-short-name} to Runner. ^[AWS-WA]^
** SSL not yet available for {partner-product-short-name} from Praefect to Gitaly. ^[AWS-WA]^
* Data at rest (AWS managed keys):
** Amazon S3 Server&#8209;Side encryption. ^[AWS-WA]^
** Amazon RDS: PostgreSQL encryption. ^[AWS-WA]^
** Amazon ElastiCache: Redis encryption. ^[AWS-WA]^
** Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) encryption. ^[AWS-WA]^

=== Database

The {partner-product-short-name} Partner Solution deploys a highly available PostgreSQL database cluster using the https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/aurora-postgresql/[Modular Architecture for Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL Partner Solution^]. Consider adjusting database instance size using the `DBInstanceClass` parameter, depending on the projected size of your {partner-product-short-name} deployment.

The following databases deploy to the same cluster:

* {partner-product-short-name} database.
* Praefect tracking database. This requires a separate tracking database, as described in https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/praefect.html[Configure Gitaly Cluster^]. 

For more information, refer to https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/advanced/external-db/[Configure the {partner-product-short-name} chart with an external database^].

=== Storage

This Partner Solution creates Amazon S3 buckets for the following use cases. Apply Amazon S3 policies to these buckets to manage retention, storage tier, and replication.

* Artifacts
* https://git-lfs.github.com/[Git Large File Storage (git-lfs)^]
* Uploads
* Packages
* Terraform
* Pseudonymizer
* Registry
* Backup
* Backup temp

By default, the contents of each bucket are encrypted with Amazon S3 server&#8209;side encryption (SSE-S3). The name of each bucket is generated and exported as SSM parameters (refer to the <<Exports>> section). For more information, refer to https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/advanced/external-object-storage/[Configure the {partner-product-short-name} chart with an external object storage^].

==== Git repository storage

The {partner-product-short-name} Partner Solution uses Amazon EBS volumes on Gitaly cluster instances. ^[GL-RAR]^

=== Backups

Backups include {partner-product-short-name} database snapshots and the contents of {partner-product-short-name} projects, such as Git repositories and wiki pages. For the following reasons, backups do not include the contents of Amazon S3 buckets. For a list of buckets, refer to <<Object storage for {partner-product-short-name} storage types>>.

* Contents of these buckets (for example, pipeline artifacts or Docker images) may be large and affect the stability and performance of backup jobs.
* Amazon S3 is a https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/#Durability_.26_Data_Protection[durable storage^] option.
* Amazon S3 storage policies also enable out-of-Region replication and management of storage class migration to control costs for older data.

==== Schedule backups

A cron expression controls the backup schedule and the default value is `pass:[0 1 * * * *]`, which runs daily at 1:00 AM. To set a different schedule, use the `BackupSchedule` parameter.

==== Backup and restore resources

NOTE: The disk volume required for backups is 2x larger than the backup tarball, so ensure that you download all resources and packages first to a tarball file (stored locally). Consider the size of your {partner-product-short-name} database and projects (mainly Git repositories) to set the size of the underlying Amazon EBS volumes appropriately using `BackupVolumeSize` parameter.

During testing, the average size of backups for the default configuration is 20 GB, and it takes about 30 minutes to create and upload backups to an Amazon S3 bucket.

For large {partner-product-short-name} deployments, use `BackupCpu` and `BackupMemory` parameters to adjust the CPU and memory requirements for backup and restore pods.

For more information, refer to https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/backup-restore/[Backup and restore a {partner-product-short-name} instance^].

=== Telemetry and monitoring

This Partner Solution provides the following consoles for metrics and logs.

==== Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights

To collect, aggregate, and summarize metrics and logs, set the `ConfigureContainerInsights` parameter to `Yes`. This integrates the Partner Solution with the Amazon EKS cluster using https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ContainerInsights.html[Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights^]. Access these logs and metrics from the Amazon CloudWatch console, as shown in <<cloudwatch-container-insights>>.
